          Education has always been the cornerstone of my journey into the tech
          world. Pursuing a Bachelor's in Information Technology at Veer
          Surendra Sai University Of Technology Burla, Sambalpur has provided me
          with a solid foundation in computer science and software engineering
          principles.

          My academic journey has been complemented by hands-on projects and
          coursework, enabling me to build practical skills and a deep
          understanding of modern technological solutions.
